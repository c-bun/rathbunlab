title: Optical control of antibiotic resistance
---
body: 

We believe in working smarter, not harder, so we are developing new
ways to evolve new bioluminescent tools.

Currently, we are interested in optical control of antibiotic resistance. 
We have developed protein-based sensors that tie survival of bacterial cells to the presence of blue light.
This will allow us to evolve brighter bioluminescent probes because only 
the brightest mutants will survive.
