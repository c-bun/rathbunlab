title: Optical control of antibiotic resistance
---
body: 

We believe in working smarter, not harder, so we are developing new
ways to evolve new bioluminescent tools.

Currently, we are interested in optical control of antibiotic resistance. 
This will allow us to evolve brighter bioluminescent probes because only 
the brightest probes will survive.
