title: Evolution of PFOS-degrading enzymes
---
body: 

We are also applying our expertise in protein engineering to evolving new enzymes to degrade polyfluorinated 
environmental contaminants. *This project is in collaboration with Dr Hunter Schroer and Professor Craig Just and U Iowa.*

**We have submitted an NSF grant for this research project.**
