title: Evolution of PFOS-degrading enzymes
---
body: 

We are also applying our expertise in protein engineering to evolve new enzymes to degrade polyfluorinated 
environmental contaminants. PFOS and related molecules are ubiquitous in our environment, and are detrimental to human health. 
We are evolving a cocktail of new enzymes to degrade these molecules *directly* in the soil.
This project is in collaboration with Dr Hunter Schroer and Professor Craig Just and U Iowa.

**We are working on an NSF grant for this research project.**
